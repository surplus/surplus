# Surplus Compiler

This is the base Surplus compiler transformer logic,
and a basic CLI utility called `surplus-transform`.

> **NOTE:** This is only the compiler; it does not include the runtime.

## Usage

Check the docs. For now, running `cargo doc --open` is the best way.

For the CLI utility, run `cargo run -- --help` for usage.
